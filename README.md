This channel is for people who are primarily traditional ETL developers (Pentaho, Talend...), or Analytics Tools users (Tableau, Crystal Reports, QlikView, Cognos, Board.. or others), or others who would like have a clear view of end to end development of a web site through analytics logging, ETL, and archive and aggregation for reporting. We will contrast and compare traditional data sources used for analytics: server logs, database records, and embedded page JS (google analytics, Adobe analytics) and get an understanding of why they give different counts. This is development intensive but we will explain each step. The bulk of the videos will entail configuring and creating entities on AWS. Feel free to just watch the videos, although a better experience will be gained by creating your own AWS account and following through with what we do. Feedback is always appreciated, thank you, Steve McCabe
